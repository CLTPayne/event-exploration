# Event Handling in Javascript

Exploring listening for and handling events in JavaScript without the help of a library like React.

### Aim

1. Understand how to use exisiting browser events to create custom interactions between the user and the site.
2. Investigate libraries for emitting custom events as a kind of pub / sub or observer pattern to create more complex behaviour and interactions between user and the site.

### Task 1

The balloon exercise from [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/15_event.html#i_ZPJB9UFdQA)

Getting started:

-   Git clone this repo
-   Change directory into the cloned project
-   Use `http-server .` to spin up a local server and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
-   Press the up or down arrow keys, lots of times!

Behaviour:

-   The page is listening for up or down arrow key presses.
-   Default scroll behaviour of the up and down arrow keys is overridden with custom behaviour.
